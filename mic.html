    <p> Mike Hopkins remembers trudging across a snowy Syracuse University campus as a wide-eyed freshman in 1989.
        Everything
        about the school was new to the young basketball player from California.

        Then — out of nowhere — someone lent a helping hand.

        As he did for countless others, Department of Public Safety official Grant Williams Jr. gave Hopkins advice and
        provided
        him with an insider’s take on the campus.

        “Grant wasn’t a police officer,” said Hopkins, now an assistant basketball coach at SU. “He was a coach. A
        developer of
        talent. A developer of people.”

        This story and many more helped honor Williams’ life during his funeral service at Hendricks Chapel on Saturday.
        Colleagues, friends, family, and SU students past and present paid tribute to his life during the two and half
        hour
        ceremony. After more than 40 years as a DPS official at SU, Williams died of cancer on Nov. 27. He was 69.

        Forever known for his unwavering generosity in the campus community, Williams always looked for the best in the
        people.
        His colleagues remember him saying, “Even if a kid is 99 percent bad, I’ll find and focus on that other one
        percent.”

        Williams leaves a deep footprint here at SU.

        “His kindness, his dedication and overall tremendous attitude toward anybody,” DPS official Joseph Shanley said.
        “He was
        a good gentleman to go to for support and help and advice. He was just a wonderful example of what it is to be a
        man.”

        At the podium Saturday, Tom Wolfe, the dean of student affairs, struggled to pick one story to tell. There were
        too many
        to choose from.

        But one story rose above the rest in his memory. Wolfe remembered a student protest on campus. It was Williams’
        job to
        keep an eye on the situation. Watching nearby, Wolfe soaked in Williams’ approach to the chaos.

        Williams inched closer and closer to the students. Eventually, he was thrust into the middle of it all. He
        didn’t try to
        break up the protest or scold anybody. Instead, he let the students know he was there for their safety.

        “He had a calm, non-threatening presence,” Wolfe said.

        This approach drove Williams’ service as a DPS official. Suresh Thiagarajan, an associate with the Evangelical
        Chaplaincy at Syracuse, saw Williams’ approach with students firsthand.

        Williams often talked to new students at Hendricks, Thiagarajan said. With a gentle-giant approach, his
        unrelenting goal
        was to assure students that the DPS exists to help them.

        “He’s a man who loved people and cared for people,” Thiagarajan said. “He was a man who lifted people up. He
        raised them
        up. He’s a man of great faith, a great visionary that helped people.”

        So when DPS Chief Tony Callisto referred to Williams as a “Glimpse of God” during the funeral, Thiagarajan
        agreed
        whole-heartedly.

        “That’s a true picture of him,” Thiagarajan said. “He was always an uplifting man that cared for people and gave
        his
        best.”

        Whether he was inviting athletes into his office or helping mourning families deal with a death, Williams tried
        to touch
        all the lives he could.

        “He had a passion for God and a compassion for people,” said Ernest Morrow, a minister at Syracuse’s Church of
        All
        Nations. “Forty years of loving and serving tirelessly. He loved all people he came into contact with.

        “He welcomed students into the campus and tried to be a father, tried to be a brother. And he was such a humble,
        genuine
        man that he radiated love wherever he went.”

        Hopkins grew from a player into a coach during Williams’ time at SU. He’s one of countless athletes who went to
        Williams
        for advice. Hours before Syracuse’s basketball game against Maine on Saturday, Hopkins rattled off the names of
        former
        players who Williams helped — Jonny Flynn, Jason Hart and Derrick Coleman, among others.

        Williams was always there, always ready to reinforce the positive.

        Toward the end of Hopkins’ speech, tears began dripping out. He looked down at Williams’ casket and managed to
        say one
        more thing.

        “You will be missed.”

        <h3>William Branham an AMerican Evangelist and prophet of God <br> who propagated the gospel around the world in
            the 20th century</h3>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>William Marrion Branham was born April 6, 1909 in Kentucky near Burksville. His parents were extremely poor
            farmers. As Branham got older they moved to Jeffersonville, Indiana. <br> They were so poor he did not have
            a shirt to wear to school and he would wear a winter coat inside so he would not have to expose his poverty.
            <br> He had no religious training, but at an early age heard a voice say to him "Do not drink or smoke or
            defile your body in any way, for when you get older I'll have a work for you to do." <br> This so terrified
            the boy he ran away as fast as he could.</p>
        <p>Branham did not have a grid for what had happened to him, but tried to obey what he'd heard. He continued to
            struggle with God, and when his brother Edward died he began to seek Him. <br> Still it wasn't until he
            became seriously ill that he turned his life around. He believed he was about to die. While he was in the
            hospital he heard the same voice that had spoken to him in his childhood. It repeated the same thing three
            times 'I called you and you would not go.' He told God "if you let me live I'll preach the gospel". He felt
            somewhat better that day. After he got out of the hospital he began to seek a church that would lead him to
            repentance. He found a disciples church that believed in the baptism of the Spirit and anointing with oil.
            They prayed for him and he was instantly healed</p>
        <p>He was on fire from that point on. For six months he cried out to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. One
            day God's presence came upon him in a mighty way. He felt God called him to preach the gospel and pray for
            the sick. He was 24 years old and he began holding tent meetings and doing what God had asked him to do. He
            saw many people converted. In 1933 he also saw a series of visions that spoke about the coming years
            including the rise of Nazism, Facism, and Communism.</p>
        <p>With his ministry now rolling, he built an independent Baptist church in Jeffersonville, Indiana. These were
            happy years for Braham. He married and had two children. During this time he became interested in the
            Pentecostal message, which was still highly controversial at that time. He attended a Pentecostal
            convention, and was asked to join them as a traveling evangelist. He believed that this was God, but was
            talked out of it by friends who thought it too controversial. He turned them down. Everything seemed to go
            wrong for him from that point on. His church began to fail and his wife and daughter were killed in the Ohio
            River flood of 1937. He believed he was under judgement from God for not doing what he was called to do.</p>
        <p>Branham struggled over the next several years. He worked as a game warden, and a logger, and sometimes
            preached. He married his second wife Meda, and eventually had three more children. One day he went off to
            pray by himself to see if could find out God's heart for him. He repented of his choice to not go with the
            Pentecostals. On May 7, 1946 he had a visitation from an angel of God. The angel said he was a seer prophet
            and would have two distinct signs in his life. The first was that he would be able to detect illness in
            people, and the second was that he would see sins in their life they needed to repent of.</p>
        <p>Branham started his healing ministry immediately after this visitation. He started in St. Louis and then went
            to Texas, Louisiana, Florida, California, and eventually all over the United States. In 1948 Branham was
            visited by Jack Moore, a pastor out of Shreveport, Louisiana. He was so impressed he took Branham to several
            churches across the United States. When Moore had to return to his home church he contacted Gordon Lindsay,
            who took over as Branham's campaign manager. The meetings were so dramatic that Moore, Lindsay, and Branham
            began the magazine and organization named "The Voice of Healing" which was headquartered in Shreveport,
            Louisiana. The original purpose was to report on Branham meetings, although it later expanded to include
            many other healing evangelists. On one campaign trip in Florida F.F. Bosworth, who had an extensive healing
            ministry of his own, joined the organization to support Branham's ministry.</p>
        <p>These meetings kicked off the healing revival that began in 1947 and continued through the 1950s. Although he
            was the first, and most wel-known, several other healing evangelists were also raised up including A.A.
            Allen, Jack Coe, and Oral Roberts. Branham said himself that "Deaf, dumb, blind, all manners of diseases
            have been healed, and thousands of testimonies are on record to date. I do not have any power of my own to
            do this... God always has something or someone to work through, and I am only an instrument used by Him."
            The most famous healing in the history of the healing revival was when William Branham prayed for US
            Congressman William Upshaw from California. Upshaw had been crippled in a farming accident as a youth and
            was healed when Branham prayed for him. Branham eventually took international trips to Canada, Mexico,
            Europe, Africa, Finland, Australia, and India.</p>
        <p>In the mid 1950's things began to go wrong for Branham. He had run his organization in a loose manner and
            felt God would take care of everything. In 1955 Branham started having financial problems. He was not having
            the same success in his meetings and was having trouble covering his expenses. The California Campaign put
            him $15,000 in debt. Others were called on to help make up the differences. The IRS began a review of his
            finances and found he had never kept good records of the money that flowed in and out of his ministry. He
            was not keeping an extravagant lifestyle. In fact he lived an extremely simple life. Branham just didn't
            track where the money went. The outcome was an IRS settlement where Branham owed the government a staggering
            $40,000 in back taxes.</p>
        <p>By 1957 it was clear that God was taking his hand off the healing movement. Branham was exhausted and refused
            to do large meetings anymore. He was surrounding himself with supporters who began to control who was
            allowed to see him and who wasn't. Some of his teachings were very unusual and by the 60s even considered
            heretical. Gordon Lindsay was warned by Kenneth Hagin that the Lord was going to take Branham home because
            Branham was gettng into false doctrine. Gordon Lindsay attempted to see Branham a month before he died, but
            was refused access to Branham by the men around him. Some of those same men were suggesting that he was
            Elijah the prophet heralding the end times. Lindsay believed Branham was falling into the same delusion that
            took John Alexander Dowie and wrote that in the Voice of Healing magazine. People who knew Branham say that
            he never made the Elijah claim on his own. Things were definitely out of balance in Branham's life. He
            ministered primarily in Arizona for the Full Gospel Businessman's Association in the winters the last few
            years of his life to support his family.</p>

        <p>In 1964 Branham had a vision where he was riding tired into the sunset. He understood that God was warning
            him that he would die soon. In 1965, while driving to Tucson, Arizona Branham's car was struck by a drunk
            driver. He lived a few day longer and then died on Christmas Eve, 1965. A couple of years before his death
            he asked his dear friend Jack Moore and his daughter Anna Jeanne to write his biography. He warned them that
            there would be a lot of confusion that would come in about his life after he died. Unfortunately they did
            not have the time to do what he asked, and confusion did come in. Some people created a religious group
            around Branham's teachings, becoming referred to as Branhamites. Others wrote him off as a heretic. Branham
            was, and continues to be, a highly controversial figure in the healing movement. The best known book written
            about Branham is Gordon Lindsay's "A Man Sent From God", which was published in the 1950's at the height of
            his fame and influence.</p>
